## About Me

Howdy y'all! I'm Joseph D. Smith, a passionate developer dedicated to creating secure and innovative open-source software. My work focuses on enhancing privacy and security for users worldwide. I'm currently working on my **Secunetcon** project, an all-in-one cybersecurity toolkit utilizing `execute` comnands.

## My Mission 

My mission is to end mass surveillance once and for all, which I aim to do with my Secunetcon project, which you can use by running the `execute` commands in it's CLI bar. So, when you run the `execute` commands in the **Command Line Interface** (or **CLI**) bar, you're not only protecting yourself against online threats, you're also making the world a safer place for **everyone**; where privacy is a **right** and not a privilege!

## Secunetcon

**Secunetcon** stands for **Secure Network Configurations**. It's a free and open-source project designed to help users configure their network settings securely to protect against mass surveillance and other privacy threats using its CLI to **execute** commands for your relevant devices.
