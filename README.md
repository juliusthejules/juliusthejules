# Hello, I'm Joseph D. Smith! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate developer and the creator of **Pyodizer**, a tool designed to enhance privacy and security through smart configuration of devices and networks. My work focuses on giving users control over their digital environment, making it easier to protect their anonymity and secure their connections.

## About Me

With a deep interest in privacy and security, I created **[Pyodizer](https://juliusthejules.github.io/pyodizer/)**, a Python-based configuration tool that anonymizes devices, blocks external IP traffic, disables telemetry, and configures firewalls. My aim is to make security accessible to anyone, empowering individuals to safeguard their digital identity without hassle.

I am always interested in collaborating with like-minded developers and exploring new ways to protect user data and privacy. Feel free to connect with me!
