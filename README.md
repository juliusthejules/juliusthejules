Howdy y'all! I'm Joseph D. Smith, a passionate developer dedicated to creating secure and innovative open-source software. My work focuses on enhancing privacy and security for users worldwide. 

## My Mission 

My mission is to end mass surveillance once and for all. So, when you download and extract the Secunetcon archive files, you're not only protecting yourself against online threats, you're making the world a safer place for **everyone**; where privacy is a **right** and not a privilege!

## Secunetcon

**Secunetcon** stands for Secure Network Configurations. It's a free and open-source project designed to help users configure their network settings securely to protect against mass surveillance and other privacy threats.
